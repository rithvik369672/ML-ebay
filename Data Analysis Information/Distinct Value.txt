1. This data have 5 differerent category         
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
The data in each category is inbalance.

1    501570
2    327871
3     95437
4     42866
5     34531

We can see the 5 category has the less value. So we really need to be careful about data bias.

2. Total data size is 1002275 

3. Because there are too many different colors in the data size ( For example, the first 2000 row has 128 unique value), we need to decide how to category the color into roughly 20 categories.

Of the 1006089 listings, there are around 5830 cells with no attributes. I think we should discard them immediately
